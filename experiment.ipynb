      "Tree boosting is a highly effective and widely used machine learning method.\n",
      "In this paper, we describe a scalable end-to-end tree boosting system called XGBoost, which is used widely by data scientists to achieve state-of-the-art results on many machine learning challenges. We propose a novel sparsity-aware algorithm for sparse data and weighted quantile sketch for approximate tree learning.\n",
      "More importantly, we provide insights on cache access patterns, data compression and sharding to build a scalable tree boosting system.\n",

Our experience shows that cache access patterns, data compression and sharding are essential elements for building a scalable end-to-end system for tree boosting. These lessons can be applied to other machine learning systems as well.\n",

      "In this section, we introduce the weighted quantile sketch algorithm.\n",
      "Approximate answer of quantile queries is for many real-world applications.\n",
      "One classical approach to this problem is GK algorithm~\\cite{Greenwald:SIGMOID01} and extensions based on the GK framework~\\cite{Zhang:SSDBM}.\n",
      "The main component of these algorithms is a data structure called quantile summary, that is able to answer quantile queries with relative accuracy of $\\eps$.\n",
      "Two operations are defined for a quantile summary:\n",
      "\\begin{itemize}\n",
      "\\item A merge operation that combines two summaries with approximation error $\\eps_1$ and $\\eps_2$ together and create a merged summary with approximation error $\\max(\\eps_1,\\eps_2)$.\n",
      "\\item A prune operation that reduces the number of elements in the summary to $b+1$ and changes approximation error from $\\eps$ to $\\eps + \\frac{1}{b}$.\n",
      "\\end{itemize}\n",
      "A quantile summary with merge and prune operations forms basic building blocks of the  distributed and streaming quantile computing algorithms~\\cite{Zhang:SSDBM}.\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to use quantile computation for approximate tree boosting, we need to find quantiles on weighted data. This more general problem is not supported\n",
      "by any of the existing algorithm.  In this section, we describe a non-trivial weighted quantile summary structure to solve this problem.\n",
      "Importantly, the new algorithm contains merge and prune operations with \\emph{the same guarantee} as GK summary.\n",
